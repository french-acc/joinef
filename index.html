    <h1>French/acc</h1>
    
    <p class="intro">We're building a community for those with global ambition for the French ecosystem. <a href="https://t.me/+5lvxz8q1u6E2NjM0">Join us on Telegram</a></p>
    
    <h2>France is the country of Alain Aspect, Cédric Villani, Yann Le Cun</h2>
    
    <p>Not the country of Apple, Meta, or Nvidia. We believe there is a fundamental mismatch between the abundance of extraordinary talent in France and the amount of globally important companies France has produced. Yes, the current momentum in Paris is very real: the rise of well-funded exceptional AI startups is a clear sign that the ecosystem is getting stronger. But the hope of making France a major powerhouse in tech is not new. Despite slow and consistent progress, France still does not have a global tech category leader, and for the most part, the world continues to bet against France being a defining technological force of the 21st century.</p>
    
    <h3>What's holding France back?</h3>
    
    <p>It's easy to hide behind some structural difficulties: yes, the ecosystem density is not as high as that of the Valley, yes, the European market is more fragmented than the US, which leads to a distribution disadvantage, and yes, the funding ecosystem, from seed to IPO, is obviously not on par with the US. But we believe these structural hurdles should not be an excuse: the global ambition of exceptional founders can outweigh all of them. If there's a place on Earth that can benefit from an accelerationist mindset, it's France.</p>
    
    <h3>The Community</h3>
    
    <p>Mistral, H, Kyutai, Gladia, Poolside, Kili, Alice & Bob or Dust, etc.: French genius operates at the cutting edge. So if you think the foundation of a great company is hidden somewhere in a research paper, a technical discord group, or Reddit thread, if you have ideas that no one else has, <strong>French/acc</strong> is the place for you. We also believe there can't be global success without global ambition, and we want the community to be international. So, if you're a foreigner in Paris, <strong>French/acc</strong> is also the place for you.</p>

    <p>If you share that level of ambition for the French ecosystem and get ridiculed for it, we're building a community for you. We believe community building and structured serendipity are essential for France to fulfill its technological ambition.</p>
    
    <p>Students, startup founders, employees, and anyone interested in accelerating through technology in France is invited to <a href="https://t.me/+5lvxz8q1u6E2NjM0">join us on Telegram</a>.</p>
